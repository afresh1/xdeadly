Basic TODO list for getting xdeadly to a point to replace the C version

* Lots of tests for everything
* Write XDeadly::Passwd that will talk to the password file from the C version
  * Needs to provide a small API
  * my %info = ->check( $user, $pass );
    * %info should contain the fields from the password file, especially role
    * should probably not return the password itself, even the encrypted version
  * my $success = ->add( %info ); # see above for description of %info
  * my $success = ->disable( $user );
* Add authentication and authorization to the app
  * Add session support
  * With rotating keys so the sessions expire
* Flesh out all the empty routes in the script, applying authorization as needed
  * get '/submit';
  * post '/submit';
  * get '/deauth';
  * get '/login';
  * post '/login';
  * get '/register';
  * post '/register';
  * get '/prefs';
  * post '/prefs';
  * get '/submissions';
  * post '/edit';
* Fix the rest of the XXX FIXME () XXX items, there are a lot.
  * Many of them probably just need conversion to the right Mojo method
  * some are more work
    * poll
    * editors
    * yesterday
* Add moderation
* Add search capabilites
* Make sure all objects notice changes on the filesystem and reload
* Use file locking to keep from overwriting files
* Add support for approving and unapproving stories
* Add support for going back in time; seeing "yesterday's edition"
* Enable Mojolicious::Validator::Validation csrf support and protection of inputs
* Add a /cgi helper that redirects old links to the new location
