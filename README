The undeadly.org web site consists of the following components

  1) Web server

     Any web server that can run CGIs will do, I'm using thttpd (from ports)
     as it has lower overhead than Apache.

     The configuration is very basic

       port=80
       dir=/var/www/htdocs
       chroot
       vhost
       user=www
       cgipat=**

     Apache can be used as well, with a configuration like

       <VirtualHost 129.128.5.155:80>
		ServerName undeadly.org 
		ServerAlias www.undeadly.org 
		ServerAdmin daniel@benzedrine.cx
		ErrorLog logs/undeadly_error_log
		CustomLog logs/undeadly_access_log combined
		DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs/undeadly
		DirectoryIndex index.html cgi index.cgi
		ScriptAlias /cgi "/var/www/htdocs/undeadly/cgi"
		<Directory />
			Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
			AllowOverride None
		</Directory>
		<Directory "/var/www/htdocs/undeadly/data">
			AllowOverride None
			Options None
			Order allow,deny
			Deny from all
		</Directory>
       </VirtualHost>

     The directory layout is

       /var/www/htdocs/undeadly/

         cgi		the executable cgi
         cgi.conf       configuration read by the cgi
         index.html	simple page that redirects to the cgi
         images/	images
         html/		HTML templates
	 htdig/		search engine data (see below)
         data/		contains articles and comments
           20040414120101/	one subdirectory per SID
             article		the article (with headers and body)
             article.more	optional 'read more' part
             14/		one subdirectory per comment
		comment		the comment (with headers and body)
		comment.mod	optional moderation results
		17/		nested comments (threads)
		    ...
           submission/		subdiretory for submitted article

     cgi.conf example (note: all paths within chroot)

       # example configuration for undeadly main cgi
       domain		undeadly.org
       datadir		/htdocs/undeadly/data
       htmldir		/htdocs/undeadly/html
       htdigdir		/htdocs/undeadly/htdig
       passwd		/htdocs/auth/undeadly.org.passwd
       secret		/htdocs/auth/undeadly.org.secret
       logfile		/htdocs/auth/undeadly.org.log
       baseurl		cgi
       authurl		https://undeadly.org/
       ct_html		Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
       vuxmlfile	/htdocs/undeadly/vuxml/vuln.asc
       mailaddr		daniel@benzedrine.cx

  2) Search engine

     ht://Dig craws the data directory (through the local filesystem)
     and builds berkeley databases. A slightly hacked htsearch binary
     is forked/execd by the cgi to retrieve search results for queries.

     htdig needs some small patches so it treats the article files
     (without file name extention) as HTML, and to extract the title
     and date of last modification from their proprietary formats,
     see README.htdig for details.

     Two configurations and databases are used, a small one with just
     articles and a larger one for articles and comments.

       htdig/
           bin/htsearch			patched searcher
           bin/htdig			patched crawler
           conf/htdig_articles.conf
           conf/htdig_comments.conf
           db_articles/
           db_comments/

  3) Authentication server

     Editors must authentiate before being able to edit/publish/delete
     submitted articles. stunnel is set up to listen on https (443) and
     run a little server (HTTP and cgi-like). After a successful (SSL-
     encrypted) HTTP basic authentication, it gives the client a HTTP
     cookie and redirects back to the normal web site. The main cgi uses
     the cookie to grant elevated privileges.

       /var/www/htdocs/auth/
           cgi			the authentication server
           undeadly.org.secret	a secret used to sign sha1 hashes
           undeadly.org.passwd	the user table with plain text passwords
           undeadly.org.log	authentication related error log

     Note that secret and passwd are used by the main cgi as well (to
     check sha1 signatures of auth cookies), but must be inaccessable
     through the web server to users.

     The secret file should contain a single line with a random
     (unguessable) string, like

       $ openssl rand -base64 40 >undeadly.org.secret

     The passwd file contains users, one per line, like

       # user:group:password:realname:email:comment
       dhartmei:admin:foobar:Daniel Hartmeier:daniel@benzedrine.cx:hi there

     Valid groups are 'admin' and 'editor'. Admins have some additional
     privileges (can edit/delete others' articles, can delete comments).

       /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

           cert		= /etc/ssl/private/stunnel.crt
           key		= /etc/ssl/private/stunnel.key
           chroot	= /var/www/htdocs/auth
           pid		= /var/www/htdocs/auth/stunnel.pid
           setuid	= _stunnel
           setgid	= _stunnel

           [https]
           accept	= 443
           exec		= /cgi
           execargs	= cgi
           TIMEOUTclose	= 0
           TIMEOUTidle	= 10

  4) General system tuning

     /etc/sysctl.conf

       kern.somaxconn=1024		# max. listen(2) backlog
       net.inet.tcp.sendspace=65536	# TCP send buffer size
