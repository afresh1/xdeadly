Welcome, editors! Thank you for joining the team and making this web site
a valuable resource for our readers. Please read the following notes
before using the editor features.<p>

<center><b>*** News ***</b></center>
There's a mailing list for editors now, please send an email with body
<i>subscribe editors your@email.addr</i> to
<a href="mailto:editors-request@undeadly.org">editors-request@undeadly.org</a>.
<p>

You can add stories to the submission queue just like any reader, all
submissions show up on this page. Here, you can edit stories, preview
and save changes. If you see a submission that is clearly inadequate,
feel free to delete it to keep the queue small.<p>

Before you publish a story, make sure you fill out all the relevant
fields:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a meaningful <i>Subject</i></li>
  <li>put your login name into <i>Contributed by</i>,
      this ensures that you can edit your own stories
      after they are published</i>
  <li>If the story was written by someone else, start the
      <i>Front text</i> with "His-or-her-name writes: ...",
      putting the quoted text in &lt;i&gt;talic.</li>
  <li><i>Email</i> is currently not shown, so you may leave it empty</li>
  <li><i>Web page</i> should point to your own page, this will become the
      link under your login name in <i>Contributed by</i></li>
  <li>make up some witty <i>Department</i></li>
  <li>choose an appropriate <i>Topic</i>, submitters can't pick
      one yet, so this always needs checking</li>
  <li>if the entire story fits in a dozen lines or so, put everything
      into <i>Front text</i>, otherwise break the large part into
      <i>More text</i></li>
  <li>preview and double-check for invalid HTML and unbalanced
      tags</li>
</ul><p>

Once you're perfectly satisfied with the story, you can publish it.
There's no second confirmation page or undo function, once it's out,
it's out. Don't rush things, have a coffee and proof-read the story
again.<p>

You can still make changes to the story once it's published (if your
login name matches the <i>Contributed by</i>), to fix things if they
went wrong, or add follow-up comments as a story develops. Usually,
additional comments should go into the <i>More text</i> section, so
the front page doesn't change too much or grows too large.<p>

Once you're done editing, use <i>Logout</i> so you don't accidentally
click on privileged functions later on. Re-authenticating is simple,
your browser will usually cache the basic authentication details, just
re-visit <a href="https://undeadly.org/">https://undeadly.org/</a>
to login again.<p>

If you need help with anything, don't hesitate to send me an
<a href="mailto:daniel@benzedrine.cx">email</a>. Thank you for
your contributions, they are what will make this journal fly.
