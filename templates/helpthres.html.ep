<h2>Thresholds</h2>

Thresholds can be used to filter out comments based on moderation
results. Results consist of count (total number of votes cast),
up (number of positive votes), down (number of negative votes) and
sum (up - down, possibly negative when down > up).
Two kinds of filters can be used.<p>

<h3>Simple thresholds</h3>

A single numerical value filters out all comments with sum below
the specified value.

<h3>Advanced thresholds</h3>

Arbitrary expressions can specify what comments to show, using
the variables c (count), u (up), d (down) and s (sum), like<p>

<ul>
  <li>s &gt;= 0 <i>show only comments with sum greater or equal 0</i><br>
  <li>(u * 100) / c &gt;= 75 <i>show only comments with at least 75% up votes</i><br>
  <li>c &lt; 5 | (u * 100) / c &gt;= 75 <i>same as above, but show comments with less
    than 5 votes, too</i><br>
  <li>c = 0 <i>show only unmoderated comments</i><br>
  <li>c > 10 & s < 3 & s > -3 <i>show comments with many votes, but sum
    near zero (highly polarizing comments)</i><br>
</ul><p>
Arithmetic operators are +, -, * and / (division by zero results in
value zero), calculation is floating point.<br>
Comparison operators are = (equal), != (unequal), &lt; (less),
&lt;= (less or equal), &gt; (greater) and &gt;= (greater or equal).<br>
Boolean operators are | (or), &amp; (and).<br>
Parentheses work around arithmetic and comparitive parts, not boolean parts
(yet).<p>
